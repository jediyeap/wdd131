                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>My name is Jeremiah Dick Yeap and I sometimes go by Jedi. I was born and raised in Penang, Malaysia but I am currently living in Singapore. I am currently working as a Client Success Executive in a Real Estate Agency here in Singapore, helping our clients purchase their next home. I love to travel and visit different countries. It is my goal to be able to pick up at least 10 different languages and I am currently at 5.</p>
